# Routine Enforcer

#### What is this thing?

It lets you set scheduled notifications that tell you to get off your computer and do something,
ideally focused at those with ADHD whose time blindness ends up leaving them on the computer until
3am despite wishing to get to bed earlier.

You can set up a scheduled event for any time of the day, any day of the week, which when it triggers
will give you a few minutes to finish what you're doing before it either locks your screen or puts
your PC to sleep.

#### Okay I've run it but nothing has happened...

See the little red icon in the system tray by the clock? Right click it (hover your mouse over it to
see what events you've already got scheduled).

#### I messed up and created an event that's wrong!

Yeah, sorry, better event management is on my to-do list but for now if you want to edit or delete
events you will have to edit the config file at C:\ProgramData\PaulZero\WindowsRoutine\config.json
(or if that sounds hard, just delete it, then quit and re-open the app and all your events will be
gone, ready to recreate properly).

#### I wish to harass you directly and suggest things

If you have some ideas or have spotted horrid bugs then https://twitter.com/PaulZer0 is probably
where you want to go.
